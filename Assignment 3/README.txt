Hi and welcome to Group 8's GUI. Please refer to the following instructions in order to run this APP succesfully. 

1. All required installs for the modules used will be found in requirments.txt
2. Images you can you for image to text have been provided for examples sake- In Images folder 
3. Text to image runs in two different ways slow and low quality (via CPU) and fast with more increased quality via (CUDA GPU)
4 To run it faster you will be required to download Nvidia CUDA and install. Otherwise the program will naturally revert to CPU and run the program that way.
